Earthdata Search is a web application developed by [NASA](http://nasa.gov) [EOSDIS](https://earthdata.nasa.gov)
to enable data discovery, search, comparison, visualization, and access across EOSDIS' Earth Science data holdings.
It builds upon several public-facing services provided by EOSDIS, including
the [Common Metadata Repository (CMR)](https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/) for data discovery and access,
EOSDIS [User Registration System (URS)](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov) authentication,
the [Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS)](https://earthdata.nasa.gov/gibs) for visualization,
and a number of OPeNDAP services hosted by data providers.
